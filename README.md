# SVG API Project
This project seeks to showcase all the amazing things that SVG's can do! The SVG API is a powerful open-source vector graphic standard, optimized for web use.

## Why Vectors?
One can't explain vector graphics easily without comparing them to raster graphics...
- **Scalar Graphics:** A raster (or scalar) graphic is an image defined by its pixels. It has a definate width and height. For example, an image might have a width of 892 pixels and a height of 116 pixels. If you zoom in far enough, you will be able to see the individual pixel colors for his type of image. _Here are some types of scalars:_
  - .jpg (compressed)
  - .png (lossless)
  - .gif (animated)
- **Vector Graphics:** A vector graphic is an image defined by its flexible points. It has an indefinate width, height. If you zoom in a lot, the image's edges will continue to be completely smooth and crisp. _Here are some types of scalars:_
  - .svg (optimized for web)
  - .ai (for adobe illustrator)
  - .pdf (for documents)
  - .eps (decrepit)

## What is an SVG?
> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based markup language for describing two dimensional based  vector graphics. SVG is essentially to graphics what HTML is to text.

An SVG is an acronym for Scalable Vector Graphics. They
