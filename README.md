# SVG API Project
This project seeks to showcase all the amazing things that SVG's can do! The SVG API is a powerful open-source vector graphic standard, optimized for web use.

## Why Vectors?
One can't explain vector graphics easily without comparing them to raster graphics...
- **Scalar Graphics:** A raster (or scalar) graphic is an image defined by its pixels. It has a definate width and height. For example, an image might have a width of 892 pixels and a height of 116 pixels. If you zoom in far enough, you will be able to see the individual pixel colors for his type of image. _Here are some types of scalars:_
  - .jpg (compressed)
  - .png (lossless)
  - .gif (animated)
- **Vector Graphics:** A vector graphic is an image defined by its flexible points. It has an indefinate width, height. If you zoom in a lot, the image's edges will continue to be completely smooth and crisp. _Here are some types of scalars:_
  - .svg (optimized for web)
  - .ai (for adobe illustrator)
  - .pdf (for documents)
  - .eps (decrepit)

## What is an SVG?
> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based markup language for describing two dimensional based  vector graphics. SVG is essentially to graphics what HTML is to text.

An SVG is an acronym for Scalable Vector Graphics. While raster images take large amounts of bandwidth to download assets, SVG files are relatively small in filesize. The drawback is that the client's computer must process the file once it reaches their machine—however this process is comparably minimal, especially for less complex assets.

Raster images remain a better choice for realistic and textured images, like photography. Extremely complex SVG files take heavy resources to compute. As such, SVG files are usually stylized and simple.
